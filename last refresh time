Request to Check Replication Issue on AZ Side

o help with the investigation, I am attaching two screenshots for your reference:

The first screenshot highlights the replication setup with the business team's role.
The second screenshot shows the replication setup with our team's role.
You will notice a difference in the view counts between the two roles, which illustrates the replication issue.


------------------

I hope this message finds you well.

Could you please check and confirm if there are any replication issues on the AZ side?

As per the details below, we had all the pub schema views replicated on the AZ side, and everything was working as expected until recently. However, we have noticed that only some objects are being replicated instead of all of them.

Since these objects are being used for production, especially after the UAT sign-off, we request you to verify the setup and share your findings at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Here’s an updated version incorporating your current progress with Python:

**Proof of Concept (POC) for Excel Sheet Creation with Raw and Pivoted Data**  

As part of my POC, I have explored various approaches to create an Excel sheet containing two sheets: one for raw data and the other for pivoted data. Below is a summary of the methods and their progress:  

1. **Using Power BI**  
   - I created and published a Power BI report.  
   - However, I faced a limitation where only selected visuals could be exported to Excel instead of the entire page.  
   - This limitation rendered the approach unsuitable for the POC requirements.  

2. **Using Paginated Reports**  
   - I successfully created a paginated report that allowed exporting the entire page to Excel.  
   - Additionally, I configured a Power Automate flow to automate the export process.  
   - However, due to workspace configuration constraints, a Premium Per User (PPU) or Premium workspace license was required, which was unavailable.  

3. **Using Python** *(Current Approach)*  
   - I have shifted to Python for generating the Excel sheet.  
   - Currently, I can successfully create an Excel file with two sheets.  
     - The first sheet contains raw data.  
     - The second sheet contains four parallel pivot tables generated directly using Python logic.  
   - My plan is to implement the pivot logic entirely within the Python script to ensure flexibility and automation.  

This approach is progressing well, and I will continue to refine it to meet the POC requirements.

Let me know if there are any additional details you’d like to include!

Dear [Client's Name],

Thank you for highlighting the issues.

Regarding the alert: Since this is a monthly report, the daily refresh does not significantly impact the alert values. Therefore, I have removed the alert as suggested and published the updated report to the workspace.

Regarding the date format: I have also made the necessary changes to the date format as highlighted in your email.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to review or modify.

Thank you for sharing the Excel file. I have obtained the required details for the supplier reports.

However, for the Metric and Control Reports, I need your assistance in gathering the following information, as it is not currently available in the Excel file:

[List the specific information you need, e.g., "Report Owner," "Last Updated Date," etc.]
Could you please help me identify and provide these details?

I am currently working on creating a master list of all the Operational and Metric Reports received from the client for further processing. I need your assistance in preparing the Excel file for this task.

To create an **SLA Tracker Power BI dashboard**, here’s a structured approach with suggestions for visuals and design elements:  

---

### **Dashboard Layout and Visuals**

#### **1. Title and Header Section**
- **Title Placement**: Place the title at the top-center of the dashboard (e.g., "SLA Tracker Dashboard"). Use a bold, large font.  
- **Subheader**: Add a brief description, e.g., “Monitoring SLA Compliance, Breaches, and Trends.”  
- **Last Refresh Date/Time**:  
  - Use a **Card visual** to display the last refresh date/time dynamically.
  - Place it in the top-right corner for easy visibility.  

---

#### **2. Filters Section**
- **Filter Panel**:  
  - Use slicers with buttons to filter by categories of reports (e.g., **Category 1, Category 2, Category 3**).
  - Place the slicer panel on the left side or top-right corner for quick access.  
  - Additional slicers: Add filters for **date range**, **priority level**, or **region/team** if applicable.

---

#### **3. SLA Compliance Overview (KPIs)**  
- **KPI Cards**:  
  - **SLA Breaches**: Total breaches, highlighted in red.  
  - **SLA Accomplishments**: Total accomplishments, highlighted in green.  
  - **Compliance Percentage**: Use a percentage card with thresholds (e.g., Green > 90%, Yellow 70–90%, Red < 70%).  
  - Place these KPIs in a horizontal row or grid at the top for an at-a-glance summary.  

---

#### **4. Visuals for SLA Breaches and Accomplishments**  
- **Bar/Column Chart**:  
  - Show breaches and accomplishments by categories, time periods, or teams.  
  - Add color coding (red for breaches, green for accomplishments).  
- **Pie/Donut Chart**:  
  - Percentage breakdown of SLA compliance by categories or priority.  

---

#### **5. Trends Analysis**
- **Line Chart**:  
  - Display SLA breaches and accomplishments over time to identify patterns.  
  - Include filters to view by team, category, or time frame.  
- **Stacked Area Chart**:  
  - Cumulative SLA trends (e.g., breaches vs. accomplishments).  

---

#### **6. SLA Details Table**  
- **Table Visual**:  
  - Columns: Report Name, SLA Status, Category, Assigned Team/Owner, Due Date, Breach Date, Comments.  
  - Add conditional formatting for breached rows (e.g., red background for SLA breaches).  
  - Place this at the bottom or in a dedicated tab for detailed analysis.  

---

#### **7. SLA Breakdown by Priority**
- **Stacked Bar Chart**:  
  - SLA breaches vs. accomplishments grouped by **priority level** (e.g., High, Medium, Low).  
  - Helps identify critical areas requiring attention.  

---

#### **8. Top/Bottom Performers**
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**:  
  - Highlight top-performing teams/categories meeting SLAs.  
  - Highlight teams/categories with the most breaches.  

---

#### **9. Additional Visuals**  
- **Gauge Chart**:  
  - Overall SLA compliance percentage with thresholds (e.g., red, yellow, green).  
- **Heatmap**:  
  - SLA performance by categories over time (e.g., rows = categories, columns = months).  

---

### **Design Tips**
- Use consistent color schemes (e.g., green for accomplishments, red for breaches, blue for neutral metrics).  
- Ensure visuals are aligned and balanced, leaving enough white space for readability.  
- Keep the dashboard responsive for different screen sizes.

As discussed, the issues highlighted in the Excel file have been addressed and the updated report has now been published to your production workspace. You may proceed with the review at your convenience.

Note:
As mentioned during our call, the feedback regarding making YTD bold and Total Waived bold has not been implemented at this stage. Implementing this change would require modifications to the data model and thorough testing. Additionally, highlighting Total Waived as bold is not feasible in the current design, as it is part of a category rather than a calculated measure.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or require additional clarifications. We look forward to your feedback on the updated report.

    )


**Subject:** Follow-Up on YTD Column Analysis  

Dear [Manager's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well.  

After conducting a detailed analysis of the report, specifically focusing on the **YTD column**, I discovered that it is not a true calculated column. Instead, it is derived from the **Column Totals** feature of the matrix visualization. This means it is only labeled as "YTD" and does not actually represent a dynamically calculated Year-to-Date value.  

As a result, this approach could lead to incorrect outputs once the year changes, as it will not adapt to the new year's data.  

To address this issue effectively, I recommend moving forward with the approach we discussed yesterday. This involves creating a **calculated table** with a dedicated **YTD column** that accurately represents Year-to-Date values for each date. This method will ensure precision and adaptability across reporting periods.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I’m happy to get started on implementing this solution.  

Best regards,

To create an SLA (Service Level Agreement) report for your Power BI workspace showing the **last refresh time**, **duration**, and other related details for all reports, you can follow the below plan.

---

## **1. Requirements:**
- Fetch the **last refresh time** and **duration** of all reports/datasets in your Power BI workspace.
- Summarize the data in an SLA report.

---

## **2. Methods to Get Refresh Data**

### **A. Use Power BI REST APIs**
Power BI REST APIs can provide details about datasets and their refresh history.

#### **API Endpoints to Use:**
1. **Get Datasets in a Group:**
   - Endpoint: `GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/datasets`
   - Fetch the list of datasets in your workspace.

2. **Get Dataset Refresh History:**
   - Endpoint: `GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/datasets/{datasetId}/refreshes`
   - Provides details like **last refresh time**, **duration**, and status.

#### **Steps to Implement:**
1. **Generate an Access Token:**
   - Use **Azure AD** to authenticate and get an access token for Power BI REST APIs.
2. **Retrieve Workspace Details:**
   - Fetch all datasets in your workspace using the **datasets API**.
3. **Fetch Refresh Details:**
   - For each dataset, use the **refreshes API** to get the last refresh time and duration.

---

### **B. Automate with Power BI Dataflows or Power Automate**
You can use **Power Automate** or create a **Power BI Dataflow** to automate fetching this data periodically.

#### Power Automate Plan:
1. Use **Power Automate** to call the Power BI REST API for your workspace.
2. Extract the **last refresh status** and **duration**.
3. Save this data to an **Excel/CSV file** or a SQL table.
4. Build a Power BI report to monitor and visualize SLA.

---

### **C. Manual Option: Export Data from Service**
1. Go to the Power BI Service.
2. Open the **Workspace > Datasets** section.
3. Check the **Refresh History** for each dataset.
4. Export the data manually to Excel for further analysis.

---

## **3. Build the SLA Report in Power BI**
Once you have collected the data:
1. Import the data (via API results, Excel, or SQL).
2. Create visuals:
   - **Table View**: Show **Dataset Name, Last Refresh Time, Refresh Duration, and Status**.
   - **KPIs**: Track SLAs like average refresh duration, success rate, etc.
   - **Trend Line**: Visualize refresh times over a period.
3. Add slicers for filtering by **Workspace Name** or **Date**.

---

## **4. Code Snippet for Power BI REST API (Python Example)**

```python
import requests

# Authentication
access_token = 'your_access_token_here'
group_id = 'your_workspace_id'

# Get Datasets in Workspace
url = f'https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{group_id}/datasets'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
datasets = response.json()['value']

# Fetch Refresh History
for dataset in datasets:
    dataset_id = dataset['id']
    refresh_url = f'https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{group_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/refreshes'
    refresh_response = requests.get(refresh_url, headers=headers)
    refresh_data = refresh_response.json()['value']
    print(f"Dataset: {dataset['name']}, Last Refresh: {refresh_data[0]['startTime']}, Duration: {refresh_data[0]['duration']}")
```

---

## **5. SLA Metrics to Include**
- Last Refresh Time
- Refresh Duration
- Refresh Success/Failure
- Average Refresh Duration
- Datasets Missing SLA

---

Let me know if you need help implementing any of these steps or further explanations!

Yes, it is **possible to share a Power BI dataset between different workspaces**. By leveraging the **Shared Dataset** feature, you can connect to a dataset from one workspace and use it in another workspace to create reports. Here’s how you can do it:

---

## **1. Key Concept: Shared Dataset**
A dataset published to **Workspace A** can be used to build reports in **Workspace B**. This is made possible through the "Shared Dataset" capability in Power BI.

---

## **2. Steps to Share a Dataset Between Workspaces**

### **Step 1: Publish the Dataset to Workspace A**
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Build and finalize the **data model**.
3. Go to **File > Publish > Publish to Power BI Service**.
4. Select **Workspace A** (where you want the dataset to reside).

---

### **Step 2: Allow Build Permissions on the Dataset**
To use the dataset in another workspace:
1. Go to **Power BI Service** > **Workspace A**.
2. Open the **Dataset Settings**:
   - Locate the published dataset.
   - Click on the **three dots (...)** > **Manage Permissions**.
3. Grant **Build Permissions** to users/groups who need access:
   - Add specific users or groups (like your team or client).
   - Select the **Build** checkbox.

---

### **Step 3: Access the Shared Dataset in Workspace B**
Now that Build permissions are granted:
1. Go to **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Click on **Home > Get Data > Power BI Datasets**.
3. You’ll see the dataset published in **Workspace A** (under "My Workspace" or "Shared with Me").
4. Select the dataset and click **Connect**.
   - You can now create new reports based on the shared dataset.

---

### **Step 4: Save and Publish Reports to Workspace B**
1. Once the report is created using the shared dataset, save the file.
2. Go to **File > Publish** and select **Workspace B**.
3. The report will reside in Workspace B, but it will still point to the shared dataset in Workspace A.

---

## **3. Best Practices for Shared Datasets**

| **Best Practice**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Shared Workspaces**          | Ensure both workspaces are in the same Power BI tenant (organization).          |
| **Grant Build Permissions**        | Grant Build access only to users or groups who need it.                         |
| **Document the Dataset**           | Clearly communicate the dataset’s purpose, structure, and measures.             |
| **Monitor Usage**                  | Use Power BI’s **Dataset Lineage View** to track where the dataset is used.     |
| **Set Refresh Schedule**           | Ensure the dataset in Workspace A is refreshed regularly to provide updated data. |

---

## **4. Lineage View: Track Shared Datasets**
In Power BI Service, you can use the **Lineage View** to:
1. See which reports in different workspaces depend on a shared dataset.
2. Verify that reports in Workspace B correctly connect to the dataset in Workspace A.

---

## **5. Common Challenges and Solutions**

| **Challenge**                     | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dataset Not Visible in Workspace B | Verify Build Permissions are granted for the users/groups in Workspace A.   |
| Report Doesn’t Load Data           | Ensure the dataset in Workspace A is refreshed on schedule.                 |
| Access Denied                     | Confirm that users in Workspace B have access to Workspace A’s dataset.      |

---

## **Summary Checklist**
✅ Publish the dataset to **Workspace A**.  
✅ Grant **Build Permissions** to users/groups for the dataset.  
✅ Connect to the shared dataset from Power BI Desktop (Workspace B).  
✅ Publish the report to **Workspace B**.  
✅ Use Lineage View to monitor dependencies and usage.

Here’s a comprehensive structure for your document on **merging two Power BI reports**, including all methods, steps, pros, and cons. Let me know if you'd like it in a specific format like Word or PDF.

---

# **Document: Approaches to Merge Two Power BI Reports**

## **1. Objective**
The goal is to merge two Power BI reports:  
- One report resides in **our workspace**.  
- The other report resides in the **client's workspace**.  

The objective is to consolidate data, ensure consistency, and share insights while maintaining a **Single Source of Truth** for the dataset.

---

## **2. Methods to Merge Two Power BI Reports**

### **Method 1: Copy Pages/Visuals Between Reports (Manual Method)**

#### **Steps**:
1. Open both `.pbix` files in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. In the **source report**:
   - Right-click on the page(s) to be copied > **Copy**.
   - Alternatively, select individual visuals > **Ctrl + C**.
3. In the **destination report**:
   - Right-click on the page navigation area > **Paste**.
   - Paste visuals to existing or new pages.
4. Save and publish the consolidated report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward for small reports.
- No changes to the existing datasets.

#### **Cons**:

3. **Connect to Shared Dataset**:
   - In Power BI Desktop:
     - Go to **Home > Get Data > Power BI Datasets**.
     - Connect to the dataset from **Workspace A**.

4. **Create Reports in Another Workspace**:
   - Use the shared dataset to create visuals and reports.
   - Save and publish the report to **Workspace B**.

#### **Pros**:
- Promotes a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- Reduces data duplication and ensures consistency.
- Allows **collaboration** across workspaces.
- Changes in the dataset automatically propagate to all connected reports.

#### **Cons**:
- Requires proper permissions (Build Access) across workspaces.
- Dependent on the **refresh schedule** of the shared dataset.
- Complex relationships in the data model may cause issues if not documented.

---

### **Method 4: Create a Composite Model (DirectQuery + Import)**

#### **Overview**:
Power BI allows you to combine **multiple datasets** using the **Composite Model** feature. You can mix **DirectQuery** and **Import Mode** sources.

#### **Steps**:
1. In Power BI Desktop:
   - Connect to one dataset in **DirectQuery Mode** (e.g., from Workspace A).
   - Import the other dataset or source as needed.
2. Combine both datasets within the same report.
3. Build relationships, measures, and visuals.
4. Publish the report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Enables combining datasets without duplicating data.
- Provides real-time data access through DirectQuery.

#### **Cons**:
- Performance can degrade when using **DirectQuery**.
- Requires careful management of relationships and table structures.
- Not all data transformations are supported in DirectQuery.

---

## **3. Summary Table: Pros and Cons of All Methods**

| **Method**                              | **Pros**                                                                 | **Cons**                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| **Combine Datasets in Unified Model**   | Single Source of Truth, scalable, removes redundancy.                    | Time-consuming, may require rework for visuals.                             |
| **Shared Dataset Across Workspaces**    | Promotes Single Source of Truth, reduces duplication, allows collaboration.| Requires Build permissions, depends on refresh schedule of the shared dataset. |
| **Composite Model (DirectQuery + Import)** | Combines multiple datasets without duplication, real-time data access.    | Performance issues with DirectQuery, limited transformation capabilities.   |

---

## **4. Recommended Approach**

The **Shared Dataset Across Workspaces** method is recommended for merging the reports because:
- It maintains a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- It avoids duplicating datasets.
- It promotes collaboration between teams while keeping reports in their respective workspaces.

---

## **5. Next Steps**

1. Build the unified dataset and publish it to a shared workspace (e.g., **Workspace A**).  
2. Grant **Build Access** to both teams (your team and the client).  
3. Create reports in both workspaces using the **Shared Dataset**.  
4. Document the data model, measures, and refresh schedules for clarity.
