To create an SLA (Service Level Agreement) report for your Power BI workspace showing the **last refresh time**, **duration**, and other related details for all reports, you can follow the below plan.

---

## **1. Requirements:**
- Fetch the **last refresh time** and **duration** of all reports/datasets in your Power BI workspace.
- Summarize the data in an SLA report.

---

## **2. Methods to Get Refresh Data**

### **A. Use Power BI REST APIs**
Power BI REST APIs can provide details about datasets and their refresh history.

#### **API Endpoints to Use:**
1. **Get Datasets in a Group:**
   - Endpoint: `GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/datasets`
   - Fetch the list of datasets in your workspace.

2. **Get Dataset Refresh History:**
   - Endpoint: `GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/datasets/{datasetId}/refreshes`
   - Provides details like **last refresh time**, **duration**, and status.

#### **Steps to Implement:**
1. **Generate an Access Token:**
   - Use **Azure AD** to authenticate and get an access token for Power BI REST APIs.
2. **Retrieve Workspace Details:**
   - Fetch all datasets in your workspace using the **datasets API**.
3. **Fetch Refresh Details:**
   - For each dataset, use the **refreshes API** to get the last refresh time and duration.

---

### **B. Automate with Power BI Dataflows or Power Automate**
You can use **Power Automate** or create a **Power BI Dataflow** to automate fetching this data periodically.

#### Power Automate Plan:
1. Use **Power Automate** to call the Power BI REST API for your workspace.
2. Extract the **last refresh status** and **duration**.
3. Save this data to an **Excel/CSV file** or a SQL table.
4. Build a Power BI report to monitor and visualize SLA.

---

### **C. Manual Option: Export Data from Service**
1. Go to the Power BI Service.
2. Open the **Workspace > Datasets** section.
3. Check the **Refresh History** for each dataset.
4. Export the data manually to Excel for further analysis.

---

## **3. Build the SLA Report in Power BI**
Once you have collected the data:
1. Import the data (via API results, Excel, or SQL).
2. Create visuals:
   - **Table View**: Show **Dataset Name, Last Refresh Time, Refresh Duration, and Status**.
   - **KPIs**: Track SLAs like average refresh duration, success rate, etc.
   - **Trend Line**: Visualize refresh times over a period.
3. Add slicers for filtering by **Workspace Name** or **Date**.

---

## **4. Code Snippet for Power BI REST API (Python Example)**

```python
import requests

# Authentication
access_token = 'your_access_token_here'
group_id = 'your_workspace_id'

# Get Datasets in Workspace
url = f'https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{group_id}/datasets'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
datasets = response.json()['value']

# Fetch Refresh History
for dataset in datasets:
    dataset_id = dataset['id']
    refresh_url = f'https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{group_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/refreshes'
    refresh_response = requests.get(refresh_url, headers=headers)
    refresh_data = refresh_response.json()['value']
    print(f"Dataset: {dataset['name']}, Last Refresh: {refresh_data[0]['startTime']}, Duration: {refresh_data[0]['duration']}")
```

---

## **5. SLA Metrics to Include**
- Last Refresh Time
- Refresh Duration
- Refresh Success/Failure
- Average Refresh Duration
- Datasets Missing SLA

Yes, it is **possible to share a Power BI dataset between different workspaces**. By leveraging the **Shared Dataset** feature, you can connect to a dataset from one workspace and use it in another workspace to create reports. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

---

## **1. Key Concept: Shared Dataset**
A dataset published to **Workspace A** can be used to build reports in **Workspace B**. This is made possible through the "Shared Dataset" capability in Power BI.

---

## **2. Steps to Share a Dataset Between Workspaces**

### **Step 1: Publish the Dataset to Workspace A**
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Build and finalize the **data model**.
3. Go to **File > Publish > Publish to Power BI Service**.
4. Select **Workspace A** (where you want the dataset to reside).

---

### **Step 2: Allow Build Permissions on the Dataset**
To use the dataset in another workspace:
1. Go to **Power BI Service** > **Workspace A**.
2. Open the **Dataset Settings**:
   - Locate the published dataset.
   - Click on the **three dots (...)** > **Manage Permissions**.
3. Grant **Build Permissions** to users/groups who need access:
   - Add specific users or groups (like your team or client).
   - Select the **Build** checkbox.

---

### **Step 3: Access the Shared Dataset in Workspace B**
Now that Build permissions are granted:
1. Go to **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Click on **Home > Get Data > Power BI Datasets**.
3. Youâ€™ll see the dataset published in **Workspace A** (under "My Workspace" or "Shared with Me").
4. Select the dataset and click **Connect**.
   - You can now create new reports based on the shared dataset.

---

### **Step 4: Save and Publish Reports to Workspace B**
1. Once the report is created using the shared dataset, save the file.
2. Go to **File > Publish** and select **Workspace B**.
3. The report will reside in Workspace B, but it will still point to the shared dataset in Workspace A.

---

## **3. Best Practices for Shared Datasets**

| **Best Practice**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Shared Workspaces**          | Ensure both workspaces are in the same Power BI tenant (organization).          |
| **Grant Build Permissions**        | Grant Build access only to users or groups who need it.                         |
| **Document the Dataset**           | Clearly communicate the datasetâ€™s purpose, structure, and measures.             |
| **Monitor Usage**                  | Use Power BIâ€™s **Dataset Lineage View** to track where the dataset is used.     |
| **Set Refresh Schedule**           | Ensure the dataset in Workspace A is refreshed regularly to provide updated data. |

---

## **4. Lineage View: Track Shared Datasets**
In Power BI Service, you can use the **Lineage View** to:
1. See which reports in different workspaces depend on a shared dataset.
2. Verify that reports in Workspace B correctly connect to the dataset in Workspace A.

---

## **5. Common Challenges and Solutions**

| **Challenge**                     | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dataset Not Visible in Workspace B | Verify Build Permissions are granted for the users/groups in Workspace A.   |
| Report Doesnâ€™t Load Data           | Ensure the dataset in Workspace A is refreshed on schedule.                 |
| Access Denied                     | Confirm that users in Workspace B have access to Workspace Aâ€™s dataset.      |

---

## **Summary Checklist**
âœ… Publish the dataset to **Workspace A**.  
âœ… Grant **Build Permissions** to users/groups for the dataset.  
âœ… Connect to the shared dataset from Power BI Desktop (Workspace B).  
âœ… Publish the report to **Workspace B**.  
âœ… Use Lineage View to monitor dependencies and usage.

Hereâ€™s a comprehensive structure for your document on **merging two Power BI reports**, including all methods, steps, pros, and cons. Let me know if you'd like it in a specific format like Word or PDF.

---

# **Document: Approaches to Merge Two Power BI Reports**

## **1. Objective**
The goal is to merge two Power BI reports:  
- One report resides in **our workspace**.  
- The other report resides in the **client's workspace**.  

The objective is to consolidate data, ensure consistency, and share insights while maintaining a **Single Source of Truth** for the dataset.

---

## **2. Methods to Merge Two Power BI Reports**

### **Method 1: Copy Pages/Visuals Between Reports (Manual Method)**

#### **Steps**:
1. Open both `.pbix` files in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. In the **source report**:
   - Right-click on the page(s) to be copied > **Copy**.
   - Alternatively, select individual visuals > **Ctrl + C**.
3. In the **destination report**:
   - Right-click on the page navigation area > **Paste**.
   - Paste visuals to existing or new pages.
4. Save and publish the consolidated report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward for small reports.
- No changes to the existing datasets.

#### **Cons**:
- Data models remain separate, leading to **duplication of data**.
- Measures, relationships, and calculated fields need manual adjustments.
- Manual effort increases as the report grows.

---

### **Method 2: Combine Datasets in a Unified Model**

#### **Steps**:
1. In Power BI Desktop:
   - Use **Power Query Editor** to connect to all datasets/sources from both reports.
   - Clean and transform data to ensure compatibility.
   - Use **Append Queries** or **Merge Queries** to consolidate tables.
2. Design a unified **data model**:
   - Create relationships, measures, and calculated fields.
   - Remove duplicate columns or conflicting schemas.
3. Build all visuals from both reports using the new unified model.
4. Save and publish the report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Ensures a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- Efficient for long-term maintenance and scalability.
- Reduces duplication of data and models.

#### **Cons**:
- Requires time and effort to build the unified dataset.
- May require changes to existing reportsâ€™ visuals.

---

### **Method 3: Use Power BI Shared Dataset Across Workspaces**

#### **Overview**:
A dataset published in **Workspace A** can be shared and used to create reports in **Workspace B**. This is useful when reports reside in different workspaces.

---

#### **Steps**:
1. **Create and Publish the Dataset**:
   - Open Power BI Desktop and build a consolidated data model.
   - Publish the dataset to **Workspace A**.

2. **Grant Build Permissions**:

     - Go to the dataset in Workspace A.
     - Click on **Manage Permissions** and grant **Build Access** to users or groups in Workspace B.

3. **Connect to Shared Dataset**:
   - In Power BI Desktop:
     - Go to **Home > Get Data > Power BI Datasets**.
     - Connect to the dataset from **Workspace A**.

4. **Create Reports in Another Workspace**:
   - Use the shared dataset to create visuals and reports.
   - Save and publish the report to **Workspace B**.

#### **Pros**:
- Promotes a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- Reduces data duplication and ensures consistency.
- Allows **collaboration** across workspaces.
- Changes in the dataset automatically propagate to all connected reports.

#### **Cons**:
- Requires proper permissions (Build Access) across workspaces.
- Dependent on the **refresh schedule** of the shared dataset.
- Complex relationships in the data model may cause issues if not documented.

---

### **Method 4: Create a Composite Model (DirectQuery + Import)**

#### **Overview**:
Power BI allows you to combine **multiple datasets** using the **Composite Model** feature. You can mix **DirectQuery** and **Import Mode** sources.

#### **Steps**:
1. In Power BI Desktop:
   - Connect to one dataset in **DirectQuery Mode** (e.g., from Workspace A).
   - Import the other dataset or source as needed.
2. Combine both datasets within the same report.
3. Build relationships, measures, and visuals.
4. Publish the report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Enables combining datasets without duplicating data.
- Provides real-time data access through DirectQuery.

#### **Cons**:
- Performance can degrade when using **DirectQuery**.
- Requires careful management of relationships and table structures.
- Not all data transformations are supported in DirectQuery.

| **Combine Datasets in Unified Model**   | Single Source of Truth, scalable, removes redundancy.                    | Time-consuming, may require rework for visuals.                             |
| **Shared Dataset Across Workspaces**    | Promotes Single Source of Truth, reduces duplication, allows collaboration.| Requires Build permissions, depends on refresh schedule of the shared dataset. |
| **Composite Model (DirectQuery + Import)** | Combines multiple datasets without duplication, real-time data access.    | Performance issues with DirectQuery, limited transformation capabilities.   |

---

## **4. Recommended Approach**

The **Shared Dataset Across Workspaces** method is recommended for merging the reports because:
- It maintains a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- It avoids duplicating datasets.
- It promotes collaboration between teams while keeping reports in their respective workspaces.

---

## **5. Next Steps**

1. Build the unified dataset and publish it to a shared workspace (e.g., **Workspace A**).  
2. Grant **Build Access** to both teams (your team and the client).  
3. Create reports in both workspaces using the **Shared Dataset**.  
4. Document the data model, measures, and refresh schedules for clarity.
