Hi [Recipient's Name],

I have attached the updated Snowflake code for the daily and month-end reports, which are currently in use. Kindly review and let us know your feedback.

Additionally, please note the following:

Using all the revised Excel files, we have updated the historical data in the UAT tables, and the Power BI report is published on the UAT workspace for your review.

For the February month data, we have not used the Excel file shared by you, as it has already been reviewed and approved.

Please note that the UAT query was already using PHA (Physical Auction), so we have not replaced the February month data.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Raj Maheshwari

Subject: Request for Assistance in Finding a Text Comparison Tool

Hi [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well.

I wanted to check if we have any application available for comparing two text files. It would be extremely helpful for me, especially considering the recent developments where comparing files has been a frequent requirement.

If we don't have any such tool available, could you please assist in installing a text comparison plugin for Notepad++? I believe it would streamline the comparison process and save significant time.

As an alternative, I have been using dbt by creating and committing files, then overwriting them with the updated version to view the changes. However, a dedicated comparison tool would be much more efficient.

Thank you in advance for your support. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,
Raj Maheshwari
----------------------

Thank you for sharing the files. I have received them and will start working on updating the historical data in the table and correcting the script for the next refresh soon.
Could you please confirm if this script change is only for the monthly report or if any changes are required for the daily report as well?
I'll reach out if I have any questions once I begin.

------------------
Based on the investigation, it appears to be another instance of an AZ replication issue. I am actively working on resolving this issue permanently.
----------

Here’s a clear and structured reasoning for your approach:  

---

## **Reasoning for Creating Dependency Between DBT Job and PBI Refresh**

### **Background**  
The objective was to establish a reliable dependency between the completion of a DBT job and the subsequent refresh of a Power BI (PBI) report. The challenge stemmed from the fact that while the DBT job loads data into Snowflake, PBI fetches data from Azure (AZ) Snowflake with a **15-minute replication delay**.  

To manage this dependency, I evaluated two possible approaches:  

---

### **Option 1: Direct Access to AZ Snowflake for Validation**
- **Approach:** After the DBT job completes, Python would directly connect to AZ Snowflake, check for the view’s availability, and confirm the data presence before triggering the PBI refresh.  
- **Challenges Faced:**  
  - Establishing a direct connection to AZ Snowflake using Python did not work due to **connectivity issues** and **access restrictions**.  
  - Additional efforts to resolve authentication and network permissions were unsuccessful.  
  - Due to these limitations, this approach had to be **discarded**.  

---

### **Option 2: Time-Buffer Based Approach**
- **Approach:**  
  - After the DBT job completion, check its **status** using Python.  
  - If the job is successful, wait for **30 minutes** to account for the delay in AZ Snowflake replication.  
  - Implement a **loop** to initiate the PBI refresh and monitor its status.  
  - Continue until the PBI refresh completes successfully.  
- **Outcome:** This method ensured reliable synchronization without additional access to AZ Snowflake. It was a **practical and effective solution**.  

---

### **Enhancements Implemented**
Following the successful implementation of Option 2, further improvements were made based on **Sathya’s suggestions**:  
1. **Best Practices Implementation:**  
    - Improved error handling and retry mechanisms to manage unexpected failures during the refresh.  
    - Logging key details (start time, end time, status, error messages) to Snowflake for monitoring and audit purposes.  

2. **Centralized Configuration Management:**  
    - Avoided hardcoding by creating a **Snowflake configuration table** to store report-specific parameters (e.g., Group ID, Dataset ID, Attempt Limits, Polling Frequency, and Error Thresholds).  
    - Python code fetches these values dynamically, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.  

3. **Code Consolidation:**  
    - Combined all PBI refreshes into a **single Python script**.  
    - Implemented efficient looping and parallel execution to manage multiple report refreshes.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
- The second approach was successfully implemented to achieve a **seamless dependency** between the DBT job and PBI refresh.  
- By incorporating best practices and dynamic configurations, the solution became **scalable** and **easier to maintain**.  
- The streamlined approach ensured **accurate data** availability in PBI without manual intervention.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Subject:** Proposal to Eliminate View Creation from DBT and Impact on Current Jira Stories  

Hi [Manager's Name],  

Based on my recent research, I have identified an opportunity to optimize our current process by eliminating the view creation step from DBT.  

### **Proposed Change**  
- **Eliminating View Creation in DBT:** This will ensure that all data is **immediately available** in AZ Snowflake without any replication delays.  
- **Simplified Dependency Management:** Since there will be no data transfer from Snowflake to AZ Snowflake, the dependency on replication will no longer be necessary. We can now directly check for data availability in Snowflake and trigger the PBI refresh accordingly.  

### **Impact on Current Jira Stories**  
Due to this design shift, the following adjustments will be required:  
1. **Design Changes:** Update the design for all PBI reports to align with the new approach.  
2. **DBT Adjustments:** Remove unnecessary view creation from all DBT jobs.  
3. **Dependency Redesign:** Implement a simplified dependency mechanism for DBT jobs and PBI refreshes.  
4. **Best Practice Implementation:** Ensure the revised process follows best practices for monitoring and logging.  

This may result in some **delays** in completing my current Jira stories. I will ensure to provide updated timelines once the revised approach is finalized.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this, and I’m happy to discuss further if needed.  

Best regards,

I reviewed the refresh status, and the last refresh was successful, so it seems there’s no immediate need for debugging. However, I understand that the underlying view is the Sold Me view. I’ll verify the timing based on the evening job to ensure everything aligns correctly.

We can further discuss this tomorrow and go over any additional thoughts or findings.
---

Please take a look and let me know if there are any additional changes required or if I missed anything.

Looking forward to your feedback.

I have attached both the Oracle and Snowflake versions of the month-end SQL query for your reference.

Additionally, I will proceed with implementing all the suggested changes
---------

Also, we have updated the Sold Date to Report Date as per the last comment. Please confirm if this change is okay.-------
Dear Raj,

We have inserted the available historical data from the shared folder into the UAT environment for testing. Kindly review and let us know your feedback.

Additionally, if possible, please provide the missing files (January 2025 and February 2025) so that we can incorporate them into the production environment as well.

Looking forward to your response.

We are in the process of consolidating all the Month-End Excel Reports into a historical table as per the request. However, we noticed that the following files are missing from the shared folder:

January 2025 (December 2024 data)
February 2025 (January 2025 data)
Could you please confirm if these files need to be added to the historical table? If so, kindly provide them at your earliest convenience.

Looking forward to your response.

The issue is observed in the December 2024 file, where certain date columns contain integer values, including negative values. I have attached a screenshot for reference. This might be due to incorrect data entry, transformation issues, or an incorrect format applied during data extraction.

Let me know if you need any further details.

Hi [Sender's Name],
 Additionally, for data that is not in the correct format (e.g., the date column containing integer values or negative values), I am currently handling them by setting those entries as NULL.

I have identified that until September 2023, we had 17 columns, and before that, there were 3 fewer columns.

As per your suggestion, we will proceed with adding data up to September 2023. Let me know if you need any further adjustments.

Currently, there is a risk of deploying Python reports on Posit Connect if there are unintended changes to secrets. To enhance security and maintain consistency, we need to:

Prevent deployment of the scheduled reports if there are any changes in secrets.
Centralize secret management so that updates made in one place are automatically reflected across all reports, avoiding redundant secret configurations in multiple scripts.
By implementing this, we can ensure better security, reduce manual interventions, and streamline report deployments.

Subject: Metric Reports Ready for UAT Review

Dear [Recipient's Name],

We have completed the Metric Reports, and they are now ready for UAT review. Below is the path link for quick access:

[Insert Path Link Here]

The AQR report has been created using a view-based approach. We have designed four views to support the four sheets in the report.

Please let us know if you encounter any access issues with Power BI or any other reports.

We have fixed the dates in the report and attached the updated version for your review.

Regarding the volume, we have run the latest data as of today and compared it with Oracle. Below is the count comparison:

Source	Count
Oracle Data	[Count]
Report Data	[Count]
Please review the attached report and let us know if you have any further questions.

You're following the process of creating a Python package and making it available for import. Based on your steps, you're trying to:

1. **Develop a package (`shared_config`)** in a directory (`/home/PZGN90/shared_config`).
2. **Test importing the package** in a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. **Eventually deploy this package to Posit Connect** for use in a production environment.

### Current Issue:
Your package contains files like `config.py`, `setup.py`, and `__init__.py`, which indicates it's structured correctly. However, you're getting a `ModuleNotFoundError` even after adding the package path to `sys.path`.

### Recommended Approach (Option 2: Install Locally as a Package)
Since you're planning for future deployment, you should **install the package properly** instead of just modifying `sys.path`.

#### Steps to Follow:

1. **Ensure your package structure is correct**  
   Your `shared_config` directory should look like this:
   ```
   shared_config/
   ├── shared_config/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── config.py
   ├── setup.py
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ```
   The `__init__.py` file should include:
   ```python
   from .config import *
   ```

2. **Install the package locally** in Workbench using:
   ```bash
   pip install --editable /home/PZGN90/shared_config
   ```
   or inside a notebook:
   ```python
   !pip install --editable /home/PZGN90/shared_config
   ```

3. **Test the import**  
   ```python
   from shared_config import config
   ```

4. **Deploy to Posit Connect (Future Step)**  
   - Package your project:  
     ```bash
     python setup.py sdist
     ```
   - Upload it to an internal package repository or Posit Connect.

Would you like guidance on `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` for packaging?

I have created the report in Power BI, and below is the UAT workspace link for your review.

I have a few questions and observations while working on the report:

What would be the best suitable time to refresh the Power BI report?
Could you please explain the difference between location and disposal channel, as both seem to have somewhat similar values?
Could you clarify why some blanks appear in auction and disposal, while banks seem fine?
Currently, we have used the MM/DD/YYYY date format—please confirm if this is acceptable.
In the Remarketing Summary Report, we have a Definition tab explaining key metrics. If a similar tab is required for this report, kindly provide the necessary definitions.
Note: This report is developed in Power BI and will be available in the Power BI workspace, not on the shared drive or SharePoint.

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.


I have completed the requested changes and published them to the workspace. Please validate the updates and proceed with updating the app so the changes reflect accordingly.

**Subject:** Oracle Access Request Approved – Assistance Needed with IODS Tables/Views  

Dear [Recipient's Name],  

I hope you are doing well.  

Thank you for your help in raising the Oracle access request earlier. My request has now been approved, and I am able to connect to the Oracle database using SQL Developer.  

However, I am unable to see the **IODS tables/views**. I suspect that while the user has been created successfully, some permissions might be missing. Could you please check and assist in granting the necessary access?  

Please let me know if any additional details are required from my end.  

Looking forward to your support.

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Good morning.

Thank you for looking into this. However, it seems that the view counts were checked using our team’s role. Could you please confirm if the replication setup has also been verified with the business team’s role? We still observe a mismatch in the view counts between the two roles.

Additionally, here are the specific views that we suspect may not be replicated correctly:

[View Name 1]
[View Name 2]
[View Name 3]
[View Name 4]
Could you kindly check these specific objects and confirm if they are replicated as expected?

Looking forward to your findings. Let me know if any additional details are required from my end.

Best regards,

Request to Check Replication Issue on AZ Side

o help with the investigation, I am attaching two screenshots for your reference:

The first screenshot highlights the replication setup with the business team's role.
The second screenshot shows the replication setup with our team's role.
You will notice a difference in the view counts between the two roles, which illustrates the replication issue.


------------------

I hope this message finds you well.

Could you please check and confirm if there are any replication issues on the AZ side?

As per the details below, we had all the pub schema views replicated on the AZ side, and everything was working as expected until recently. However, we have noticed that only some objects are being replicated instead of all of them.

Since these objects are being used for production, especially after the UAT sign-off, we request you to verify the setup and share your findings at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Here’s an updated version incorporating your current progress with Python:

**Proof of Concept (POC) for Excel Sheet Creation with Raw and Pivoted Data**  

As part of my POC, I have explored various approaches to create an Excel sheet containing two sheets: one for raw data and the other for pivoted data. Below is a summary of the methods and their progress:  

1. **Using Power BI**  
   - I created and published a Power BI report.  
   - However, I faced a limitation where only selected visuals could be exported to Excel instead of the entire page.  
   - This limitation rendered the approach unsuitable for the POC requirements.  

2. **Using Paginated Reports**  
   - I successfully created a paginated report that allowed exporting the entire page to Excel.  
   - Additionally, I configured a Power Automate flow to automate the export process.  
   - However, due to workspace configuration constraints, a Premium Per User (PPU) or Premium workspace license was required, which was unavailable.  

3. **Using Python** *(Current Approach)*  
   - I have shifted to Python for generating the Excel sheet.  
   - Currently, I can successfully create an Excel file with two sheets.  
     - The first sheet contains raw data.  
     - The second sheet contains four parallel pivot tables generated directly using Python logic.  
   - My plan is to implement the pivot logic entirely within the Python script to ensure flexibility and automation.  

This approach is progressing well, and I will continue to refine it to meet the POC requirements.

To create an **SLA Tracker Power BI dashboard**, here’s a structured approach with suggestions for visuals and design elements:  

---

### **Dashboard Layout and Visuals**

#### **1. Title and Header Section**
- **Title Placement**: Place the title at the top-center of the dashboard (e.g., "SLA Tracker Dashboard"). Use a bold, large font.  
- **Subheader**: Add a brief description, e.g., “Monitoring SLA Compliance, Breaches, and Trends.”  
- **Last Refresh Date/Time**:  
  - Use a **Card visual** to display the last refresh date/time dynamically.
  - Place it in the top-right corner for easy visibility.  

---

#### **2. Filters Section**
- **Filter Panel**:  
  - Use slicers with buttons to filter by categories of reports (e.g., **Category 1, Category 2, Category 3**).
  - Place the slicer panel on the left side or top-right corner for quick access.  
  - Additional slicers: Add filters for **date range**, **priority level**, or **region/team** if applicable.

---

#### **3. SLA Compliance Overview (KPIs)**  
- **KPI Cards**:  
  - **SLA Breaches**: Total breaches, highlighted in red.  
  - **SLA Accomplishments**: Total accomplishments, highlighted in green.  
  - **Compliance Percentage**: Use a percentage card with thresholds (e.g., Green > 90%, Yellow 70–90%, Red < 70%).  
  - Place these KPIs in a horizontal row or grid at the top for an at-a-glance summary.  

---

#### **4. Visuals for SLA Breaches and Accomplishments**  
- **Bar/Column Chart**:  
  - Show breaches and accomplishments by categories, time periods, or teams.  
  - Add color coding (red for breaches, green for accomplishments).  
- **Pie/Donut Chart**:  
  - Percentage breakdown of SLA compliance by categories or priority.  

---

#### **5. Trends Analysis**
- **Line Chart**:  
  - Display SLA breaches and accomplishments over time to identify patterns.  
  - Include filters to view by team, category, or time frame.  
- **Stacked Area Chart**:  
  - Cumulative SLA trends (e.g., breaches vs. accomplishments).  

---

#### **6. SLA Details Table**  
- **Table Visual**:  
  - Columns: Report Name, SLA Status, Category, Assigned Team/Owner, Due Date, Breach Date, Comments.  
  - Add conditional formatting for breached rows (e.g., red background for SLA breaches).  
  - Place this at the bottom or in a dedicated tab for detailed analysis.  

---

#### **7. SLA Breakdown by Priority**
- **Stacked Bar Chart**:  
  - SLA breaches vs. accomplishments grouped by **priority level** (e.g., High, Medium, Low).  
  - Helps identify critical areas requiring attention.  

---

#### **8. Top/Bottom Performers**
- **Horizontal Bar Chart**:  
  - Highlight top-performing teams/categories meeting SLAs.  
  - Highlight teams/categories with the most breaches.  

---

#### **9. Additional Visuals**  
- **Gauge Chart**:  
  - Overall SLA compliance percentage with thresholds (e.g., red, yellow, green).  
- **Heatmap**:  
  - SLA performance by categories over time (e.g., rows = categories, columns = months).  

---

### **Design Tips**
- Use consistent color schemes (e.g., green for accomplishments, red for breaches, blue for neutral metrics).  
- Ensure visuals are aligned and balanced, leaving enough white space for readability.  
- Keep the dashboard responsive for different screen sizes.  

---

The report has refreshed successfully using my credentials. To identify and resolve the issue with your credentials, I suggest we jump on a call to replicate the scenario and troubleshoot further.

Please let me know a suitable time for the call, and I’ll ensure to assist in resolving the issue promptly.

I have reviewed the Power BI report refresh issue, and it appears to be caused by a credentials error. The current access permissions for the data source are insufficient, which is preventing the refresh from completing successfully.

To resolve this issue, the necessary access needs to be provided to Rose. Once she has the required permissions, the refresh process should function correctly.

Infrastructure Issue: I am experiencing system slowness issue during meetings or in a call. 
Issue: The system becomes unresponsive when I attempt to multitask in between meeting (e.g., accessing documents, replying to emails, or using other applications during the call) and the audio frequently breaks, making it difficult to follow conversations or contribute effectively. 
Impact: Screen sharing, which is essential for demos and collaborative work causing delays and interruptions.

As discussed, the issues highlighted in the Excel file have been addressed and the updated report has now been published to your production workspace. You may proceed with the review at your convenience.

Note:
As mentioned during our call, the feedback regarding making YTD bold and Total Waived bold has not been implemented at this stage. Implementing this change would require modifications to the data model and thorough testing. Additionally, highlighting Total Waived as bold is not feasible in the current design, as it is part of a category rather than a calculated measure.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or require additional clarifications. We look forward to your feedback on the updated report.

    )


**Subject:** Follow-Up on YTD Column Analysis  

Dear [Manager's Name],  

I hope this email finds you well.  

After conducting a detailed analysis of the report, specifically focusing on the **YTD column**, I discovered that it is not a true calculated column. Instead, it is derived from the **Column Totals** feature of the matrix visualization. This means it is only labeled as "YTD" and does not actually represent a dynamically calculated Year-to-Date value.  

As a result, this approach could lead to incorrect outputs once the year changes, as it will not adapt to the new year's data.  

To address this issue effectively, I recommend moving forward with the approach we discussed yesterday. This involves creating a **calculated table** with a dedicated **YTD column** that accurately represents Year-to-Date values for each date. This method will ensure precision and adaptability across reporting periods.  

Please let me know your thoughts, and I’m happy to get started on implementing this solution.  

Best regards,

To create an SLA (Service Level Agreement) report for your Power BI workspace showing the **last refresh time**, **duration**, and other related details for all reports, you can follow the below plan.

---

## **1. Requirements:**
- Fetch the **last refresh time** and **duration** of all reports/datasets in your Power BI workspace.
- Summarize the data in an SLA report.

---

## **2. Methods to Get Refresh Data**

### **A. Use Power BI REST APIs**
Power BI REST APIs can provide details about datasets and their refresh history.

#### **API Endpoints to Use:**
1. **Get Datasets in a Group:**
   - Endpoint: `GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/datasets`
   - Fetch the list of datasets in your workspace.

2. **Get Dataset Refresh History:**
   - Endpoint: `GET https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{groupId}/datasets/{datasetId}/refreshes`
   - Provides details like **last refresh time**, **duration**, and status.

#### **Steps to Implement:**
1. **Generate an Access Token:**
   - Use **Azure AD** to authenticate and get an access token for Power BI REST APIs.
2. **Retrieve Workspace Details:**
   - Fetch all datasets in your workspace using the **datasets API**.
3. **Fetch Refresh Details:**
   - For each dataset, use the **refreshes API** to get the last refresh time and duration.

---

### **B. Automate with Power BI Dataflows or Power Automate**
You can use **Power Automate** or create a **Power BI Dataflow** to automate fetching this data periodically.

#### Power Automate Plan:
1. Use **Power Automate** to call the Power BI REST API for your workspace.
2. Extract the **last refresh status** and **duration**.
3. Save this data to an **Excel/CSV file** or a SQL table.
4. Build a Power BI report to monitor and visualize SLA.

---

### **C. Manual Option: Export Data from Service**
1. Go to the Power BI Service.
2. Open the **Workspace > Datasets** section.
3. Check the **Refresh History** for each dataset.
4. Export the data manually to Excel for further analysis.

---

## **3. Build the SLA Report in Power BI**
Once you have collected the data:
1. Import the data (via API results, Excel, or SQL).
2. Create visuals:
   - **Table View**: Show **Dataset Name, Last Refresh Time, Refresh Duration, and Status**.
   - **KPIs**: Track SLAs like average refresh duration, success rate, etc.
   - **Trend Line**: Visualize refresh times over a period.
3. Add slicers for filtering by **Workspace Name** or **Date**.

---

## **4. Code Snippet for Power BI REST API (Python Example)**

```python
import requests

# Authentication
access_token = 'your_access_token_here'
group_id = 'your_workspace_id'

# Get Datasets in Workspace
url = f'https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{group_id}/datasets'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
datasets = response.json()['value']

# Fetch Refresh History
for dataset in datasets:
    dataset_id = dataset['id']
    refresh_url = f'https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/groups/{group_id}/datasets/{dataset_id}/refreshes'
    refresh_response = requests.get(refresh_url, headers=headers)
    refresh_data = refresh_response.json()['value']
    print(f"Dataset: {dataset['name']}, Last Refresh: {refresh_data[0]['startTime']}, Duration: {refresh_data[0]['duration']}")
```

---

## **5. SLA Metrics to Include**
- Last Refresh Time
- Refresh Duration
- Refresh Success/Failure
- Average Refresh Duration
- Datasets Missing SLA

Yes, it is **possible to share a Power BI dataset between different workspaces**. By leveraging the **Shared Dataset** feature, you can connect to a dataset from one workspace and use it in another workspace to create reports. Here’s how you can do it:

---

## **1. Key Concept: Shared Dataset**
A dataset published to **Workspace A** can be used to build reports in **Workspace B**. This is made possible through the "Shared Dataset" capability in Power BI.

---

## **2. Steps to Share a Dataset Between Workspaces**

### **Step 1: Publish the Dataset to Workspace A**
1. Open Power BI Desktop.
2. Build and finalize the **data model**.
3. Go to **File > Publish > Publish to Power BI Service**.
4. Select **Workspace A** (where you want the dataset to reside).

---

### **Step 2: Allow Build Permissions on the Dataset**
To use the dataset in another workspace:
1. Go to **Power BI Service** > **Workspace A**.
2. Open the **Dataset Settings**:
   - Locate the published dataset.
   - Click on the **three dots (...)** > **Manage Permissions**.
3. Grant **Build Permissions** to users/groups who need access:
   - Add specific users or groups (like your team or client).
   - Select the **Build** checkbox.

---

### **Step 3: Access the Shared Dataset in Workspace B**
Now that Build permissions are granted:
1. Go to **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Click on **Home > Get Data > Power BI Datasets**.
3. You’ll see the dataset published in **Workspace A** (under "My Workspace" or "Shared with Me").
4. Select the dataset and click **Connect**.
   - You can now create new reports based on the shared dataset.

---

### **Step 4: Save and Publish Reports to Workspace B**
1. Once the report is created using the shared dataset, save the file.
2. Go to **File > Publish** and select **Workspace B**.
3. The report will reside in Workspace B, but it will still point to the shared dataset in Workspace A.

---

## **3. Best Practices for Shared Datasets**

| **Best Practice**                  | **Description**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Use Shared Workspaces**          | Ensure both workspaces are in the same Power BI tenant (organization).          |
| **Grant Build Permissions**        | Grant Build access only to users or groups who need it.                         |
| **Document the Dataset**           | Clearly communicate the dataset’s purpose, structure, and measures.             |
| **Monitor Usage**                  | Use Power BI’s **Dataset Lineage View** to track where the dataset is used.     |
| **Set Refresh Schedule**           | Ensure the dataset in Workspace A is refreshed regularly to provide updated data. |

---

## **4. Lineage View: Track Shared Datasets**
In Power BI Service, you can use the **Lineage View** to:
1. See which reports in different workspaces depend on a shared dataset.
2. Verify that reports in Workspace B correctly connect to the dataset in Workspace A.

---

## **5. Common Challenges and Solutions**

| **Challenge**                     | **Solution**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dataset Not Visible in Workspace B | Verify Build Permissions are granted for the users/groups in Workspace A.   |
| Report Doesn’t Load Data           | Ensure the dataset in Workspace A is refreshed on schedule.                 |
| Access Denied                     | Confirm that users in Workspace B have access to Workspace A’s dataset.      |

---

## **Summary Checklist**
✅ Publish the dataset to **Workspace A**.  
✅ Grant **Build Permissions** to users/groups for the dataset.  
✅ Connect to the shared dataset from Power BI Desktop (Workspace B).  
✅ Publish the report to **Workspace B**.  
✅ Use Lineage View to monitor dependencies and usage.

Here’s a comprehensive structure for your document on **merging two Power BI reports**, including all methods, steps, pros, and cons. Let me know if you'd like it in a specific format like Word or PDF.

---

# **Document: Approaches to Merge Two Power BI Reports**

## **1. Objective**
The goal is to merge two Power BI reports:  
- One report resides in **our workspace**.  
- The other report resides in the **client's workspace**.  

The objective is to consolidate data, ensure consistency, and share insights while maintaining a **Single Source of Truth** for the dataset.

---

## **2. Methods to Merge Two Power BI Reports**

### **Method 1: Copy Pages/Visuals Between Reports (Manual Method)**

#### **Steps**:
1. Open both `.pbix` files in **Power BI Desktop**.
2. In the **source report**:
   - Right-click on the page(s) to be copied > **Copy**.
   - Alternatively, select individual visuals > **Ctrl + C**.
3. In the **destination report**:
   - Right-click on the page navigation area > **Paste**.
   - Paste visuals to existing or new pages.
4. Save and publish the consolidated report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Simple and straightforward for small reports.
- No changes to the existing datasets.

#### **Cons**:
- Data models remain separate, leading to **duplication of data**.
- Measures, relationships, and calculated fields need manual adjustments.
- Manual effort increases as the report grows.

---

### **Method 2: Combine Datasets in a Unified Model**

#### **Steps**:
1. In Power BI Desktop:
   - Use **Power Query Editor** to connect to all datasets/sources from both reports.
   - Clean and transform data to ensure compatibility.
   - Use **Append Queries** or **Merge Queries** to consolidate tables.
2. Design a unified **data model**:
   - Create relationships, measures, and calculated fields.
   - Remove duplicate columns or conflicting schemas.
3. Build all visuals from both reports using the new unified model.
4. Save and publish the report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Ensures a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- Efficient for long-term maintenance and scalability.
- Reduces duplication of data and models.

- Dependent on the **refresh schedule** of the shared dataset.
- Complex relationships in the data model may cause issues if not documented.

---

### **Method 4: Create a Composite Model (DirectQuery + Import)**

#### **Overview**:
Power BI allows you to combine **multiple datasets** using the **Composite Model** feature. You can mix **DirectQuery** and **Import Mode** sources.

#### **Steps**:
1. In Power BI Desktop:
   - Connect to one dataset in **DirectQuery Mode** (e.g., from Workspace A).
   - Import the other dataset or source as needed.
2. Combine both datasets within the same report.
3. Build relationships, measures, and visuals.
4. Publish the report to the desired workspace.

#### **Pros**:
- Enables combining datasets without duplicating data.
- Provides real-time data access through DirectQuery.

#### **Cons**:
- Performance can degrade when using **DirectQuery**.
- Requires careful management of relationships and table structures.
- Not all data transformations are supported in DirectQuery.

| **Combine Datasets in Unified Model**   | Single Source of Truth, scalable, removes redundancy.                    | Time-consuming, may require rework for visuals.                             |
| **Shared Dataset Across Workspaces**    | Promotes Single Source of Truth, reduces duplication, allows collaboration.| Requires Build permissions, depends on refresh schedule of the shared dataset. |
| **Composite Model (DirectQuery + Import)** | Combines multiple datasets without duplication, real-time data access.    | Performance issues with DirectQuery, limited transformation capabilities.   |

---

## **4. Recommended Approach**

The **Shared Dataset Across Workspaces** method is recommended for merging the reports because:
- It maintains a **Single Source of Truth** for data.
- It avoids duplicating datasets.
- It promotes collaboration between teams while keeping reports in their respective workspaces.

---

## **5. Next Steps**

1. Build the unified dataset and publish it to a shared workspace (e.g., **Workspace A**).  
2. Grant **Build Access** to both teams (your team and the client).  
3. Create reports in both workspaces using the **Shared Dataset**.  
4. Document the data model, measures, and refresh schedules for clarity.
